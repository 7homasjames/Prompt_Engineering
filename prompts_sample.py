    An insurance claim is a formal request made by a policyholder to their insurance company for 
    coverage or compensation for a covered loss or policy event. The process involves gathering and processing various details, 
    including the policyholder's information, such as policy number, type, coverage details, and demographics.
    Claim details include the claim number, date of loss, type of loss, location, description, estimated and actual loss amounts, 
    status, and settlement date. Financial information encompasses the premium amount, payment history, claim history, deductible, 
    and reimbursement amounts. For auto claims, specific details like the vehicle's VIN, make, model, year, value, and damage details are required. 
    In the case of home or property claims, information about the property address, type, value, and damage details is necessary. 
    Health claims involve patient information, diagnosis codes, treatment details, provider information, and payment details. 
    Fraud indicators are identified through potential red flags, anomalies, and suspicious claim patterns. 
    This comprehensive approach is used to evaluate the claim, determine coverage, and decide on the appropriate settlement.
